README for GLcpu
================

Installing
----------

You need the following to compile and install GLcpu:

* GLUT & OpenGL libraries, preferably with hardware accelleration.
* CommonC++ libraries (for the networking).
* GNU make
* G++

All you need to do is type make, and it will hopefully make itself. In
the future, some kind of autoconfig stuff should be implemented, but
I don't know how that works, so... If you have more then 1 CPU on a
machine to be monitored, you need to change the NCPU constant in
statd.cc. Sorry about that.

Thereafter you need to run make install as root. This will place two
binaries in /usr/local/bin: statd and glcpu. GLcpu is the cool program
you run that shows the graphics. Statd needs to be installed in inetd
on the computers that will be monitored. A line like the following may
work well (it must run on pport 7687):

7687    stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/statd

You then need to restart inetd, and configure glcpu. To configure
glcpu, you create a file ~/.glcpurc. You can find a sample of this file
in glcpurc.sample. The "hosts="-line is a :-separated list of hosts to
monitor.
