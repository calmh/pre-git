Installation instructions
=========================

The installation is very hacky at the moment. This will be improved as
time passes. Basically, what needs to be done is:

$ make

This should make the programs. It works under Linux and probably
_only_ under Linux, since it uses Linux-specific tape ioctls.

The tape-device is hard-coded (BAD!!) to /dev/tape. If this does not
suite you, edit stddefs.h (yes, a config file format are in the works).

# make install

This will install the binaries in /usr/local/bin and create the necessary
directory structure.

Then you need to create the .startdir, .prune and .root-files for each 
volume you want to backup, and put them in /etc/reverse. There is an example
in the example-conf dir.

Basically, the files should contain the following:

<volume>.root: a single line with the root directory of the volume
<volume>.startdir: a list of directories to backup. Note that save
                   does not cross filesystem borders.
<volume>.prune: a list of patterns of files that should not be
                backed up. This is put through a simple substring-search,
                so no fancy patterns are available, unfortunately.
volumes:	a list of tapes and what role they have. See example.

That should be about it.

You now need to label a tape:

$ label /dev/nst0 -v Name-of-tape

Add the tape to the volumes-list with a type "/backup" and you can start
doing backups.
