Replay 0.58
===========

This is a project I started beacause of the lack of a working GTK
MP3-player, and as a reason to learn GTK. It is currently in early
beta stage. It is basically a hack of amp.


Introduction
============

Replay is an MP3 player with a GTK interface. It is based on amp. It
has the following features as of today:

- Cool GTK interface.
- Theme support.
- Plays layer 3 and layer 2 files.
- Playlists (load/edit/save).
- Y2K compliant. ;)
- Can save to WAV.
- Stereo/mono playing.
- Fully controllable from command line, with options and signals.
- Double click in playlist to jump to that track.
- Seeking within a track.
- Display playing time/number of files/size for whole playlist.

Installation
============

Just put the compiled binary somewhere in your path.
Run 'replay -h' to see what command line switches are available.


Bugs
====

Probably lots. But these I know of:

- Lousy organization of the source (Sorry non-Linux users...).
- Seeking sometimes tracks crashes the player. Only happens in certain
  (damaged?) files.
