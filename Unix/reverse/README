README for the 'reverse' suite of backup utilities
==================================================

Release 4.
==========

General
=======

This is a small suite of programs to simplify my backups. They are
very much under development, still. Not all the functionality I want
is implemented, not even close, but I am working on it.

These things _are_ buggy; they do not check for all possible failure
modes as they should. If you use this for backup and it fails, it's
not my problem. There is no warranty. You have been warned.

Programs
========

The stuff that basically works as of the first release are:

* 'save' This is a program that does backups. It backs up files that
  have changed since the last backup, or all files of there is no
  index for the tape in the drive.

* 'lschunks' Shows what chunks are on a tape, when they were written,
  which volume they contain, etc.

* 'lsfiles' Gives a little more verbose info, show what files are on a 
  tape and in which chunk they are (for quicker access)

* 'label' A quick ugly little hack to make a label on a tape.

* 'archive' A nice way to stuff a directory to tape for permanent storage.
  Bypasses all pruning, and is meant for when you want to store away files
  but do it in a way so that you will have the files' location in an index.

Needed stuff
============

The backups are made with afio and compressed by gzip. You need those
programs.
