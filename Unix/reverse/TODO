Todo
=======

Thing that need to be done, or that I plan to do, in no particular order:

* Find out what in my memory handling is failing, and fixing it so
  that 'save' won't need so much memory.

* Create the 'restore' tool, with a command-line syntax slightly
  inspired from Legato.

* Use getopts for command-line switches.

* Create a 'reversed' daemon to run on computers, to be able to do
  network backups without having the remote machine NFS-mounted.
