Changes
=======

In release 4 from release 3:

* Changed format for "Available volumes" list
* Added file CONF_DIR/volumes to specify what kind of tape each tape is.
* Changed to a safer method of creating new chunks at EOT.

In release 3 from release 2:

* Added a headerfile for constant pathnames and such (stddefs.h)
* Added an 'install' target to the Makefile (you still need to read the
  Install file)
* Made lsfiles and lschunks take volume names instead of file names, and
  they show a list of volumes if you give none.

In release 2 from release 1:

Nothing major, and I didn't keep track very well. Check the patch for
details.
