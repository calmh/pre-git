Summary
-------

Keeper is a small program that talks to a PostgreSQL database, in
order to provide a general object store. The project was started to
provide a convenient method to store digital images, that a normal
filesystem structure couldn't fulfill.

Installation
------------

1. Programs

 The installation is Makefile-based.

 To install in /usr/local, simply run
 $ make
 and as root,
 # make install
 To install in /home/foo/bar/{bin/lib}, run
 # make PREFIX=/home/foo/bar install
 instead.

2. Database

 You will need access to a running and correctly configured PostgreSQL 
 database. The included script 'setupdb' will guide you through making 
 the necessary setup of the database are for keeper. 

 The script will also create a working config file, which will be
 called keeper.cf and put in the current directory. This file should be
 put in /etc, be owned by root and have a mode of 0600.

 $ ./setupdb

3.0. User privileges - Intro

 By default, only root will have access to the Keeper system, and root 
 will have complete access (privlevel = 0). The higher the privlevel
 for a user, the lower is their access. The max for privlevel is
 MAX_INT. Recommended level for a normal user is 15.

 The only operations restricted by privlevel is backup, purge  and
 user management;  these can only be executed at privlevel 0. For all
 other operations,  the privlevel is controlled at an object level, so
 that a user with a   lower privlevel can not see, access or create
 objects with a lower  privlevel than the user.

 A privileged user can manage other user through the normal keeper
 command.

3.1. User Privileges - Setting Up

 By defalt, root has a password of "". To enable root to access the
 system and change his password, a file ~root/.keeperrc must be
 created, with only the one line "password=".

 At this point, root can run keeper -P to change his password, and
 thereafter keeper -U ... to add more users.

 These users will have to do the same thing, that is create a
 ~/.keeperrc with the line "password=myPassWorRd".

 Simple, yes?
